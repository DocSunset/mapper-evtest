evtest â€” Kernel input device debugging
======================================

evtest is a tool to print evdev kernel events. It reads directly from the
kernel device and prints a device description and the events with the value
and the symbolic name.

Usage:

    evtest /dev/input/event0

Note: in most cases evtest needs to run as root to be able to read the
devices.

For more information, see the evtest(1) man page.

Development

This fork of evtest is maintained by Travis West on github: https://github.com/docsunset/mapper-evtest
